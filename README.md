# Knowledge learn

# Aim - Just a great way to learn code by adding solutions in different languages

Going to aim at trying different things for different languages etc nothing major. Good look up for reference.

Might do some structure like this:

- Root
  - README.md
  - LANG -
    - Framework
    - Tasks - Maybe so general tasks seperated?
    - adventofcode? - Maybe start this for yearly refreshes.
    - README.md

Language I am playing with, most are just languages I already know atm so just refreshing.

I think the rules I should do are:

- Obviously no gitpiolot cause it sucks
- Read docs to learn
- If I "vibe" code some shit maybe comment like #CHEATED HERE
- Good rule of thumb could be more difficult first i.e
- Minimal dependancies other than native library except frameworks obviously.

## Difficulty rating based on my knowledge (scale 1 easy 10 hard) (Fimilarity Top to bottom)

- 1: JS/TS - [JS-Doc](JS/README.md)
- 2: Terraform - Its simple and not really a language but whatevers
- 1: Docker - Cause its not a language but whatever
  - https://devhints.io/docker-compose
  - https://devhints.io/ansible
- 1: Python - Easy except for loops
  - https://devhints.io/python
- 3: Lua - Easy lang
  - https://www.lua.org/manual/5.5/
  - https://www.lua.org/pil/1.html
  - https://devhints.io/lua
- 5: go - Probably lower I just cba
  - https://devhints.io/go
  - https://go.dev/doc/
- 4: bash - [bash-Doc](bash/README.md)
- 3: PHP - [php-Doc](php/README.md)
- 6: C -[C-Doc](c/README.md)
- 8: C++ - Shit C
- 4: C# - Easy Java and pretty decent actually
- 8: Cobol - Wasn't as bad as I thought
- 6: Java - horrible
- 5: Kotlin - Easy java
- 8: rust - Seems okay but everyone says it hard so will see
- 4: Swift - I just don't like the syntax
